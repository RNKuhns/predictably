The ``predictably`` project believes that everyone should be able to participate
in our community without fear of harassment or discrimination. All contributors
are expected to show respect and courtesy to other members of the community
at all times.

.. note::

    ``predictably`` is a new project, and processes associated with the project's
    Code of Conduct (including how to report incidents) and may change as the
    project matures. However, ``predictably``'s Code of Conduct will remain
    dedicated to promoting a community without harassment and discrimination. As
    we formalize our policy, if you need to report a Code of Conduct incident,
    reach out to predictably.ai@gmail.com.
