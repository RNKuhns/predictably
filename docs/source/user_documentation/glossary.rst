    Framework
        A collection of related and reusable software design templates that
        practitioners can copy and fill in. Frameworks emphasize design reuse.
        They capture common software design decisions within a given application domain
        and distill them into reusable design templates. This reduces the design
        decision they must take, allowing them to focus on application specifics.
        Not only can practitioners write software faster as a result, but
        applications will have a similar structure. Frameworks often offer
        additional functionality like :term:`toolboxes <toolbox>`. Compare with
        :term:`toolbox` and :term:`application`.

    Toolbox
        A collection of related and reusable functionality that practitioners
        can import to write applications. Toolboxes emphasize code reuse.
        Compare with :term:`framework` and :term:`application`.

    Application
        A single-purpose piece of code that practitioners write to solve a
        particular applied problem. Compare with :term:`toolbox` and :term:`framework`.
