``predictably`` was started in August 2023 by Ryan Kuhns in an effort to make it
easier to use statistical, econometric and machine learning techniques in a consistent
way across platforms and functional areas.

The project builds on and was heavily inspired by
`scikit-learn`_ and `sktime`_ and its Python interface follows these projects closely.

Development is supported by the project's steering committee, core developers
and the broader community (see `contributors <contributors.md>`_).
