Welcome to ``predictably``'s roadmap.

.. note::

    The project is under active planning and development. We will continue to update
    our roadmap as the project matures and we plan future work.

Project Goals
=============

``predictably``'s goal is to help users predict *ably*.

To accomplish this we plan to:

- Provide an intuitive interface similar to `scikit-learn`_ and `sktime`_
- Have best in class documentation that includes information on using the package,
  as well as a broader understanding of the underlying algorithms.
- Provide cross-language support so teams that work in different languages can easily
  use the functionality.
